Ongoing translating/typesetting of a book once-burned from the swinging 160s.

Was hoping to find some juicy Gnostic bits but, don't get your hopes up, the thing actually 'bytes... The big J uses some swear words, big deal! I guess that's why it was once collected and burned?

But it definitely feels like the oldest writing I've ever spent a long time with.

Curious what AI makes of it: the register is very hard to match in up-to-date English.

The original Syriac comes through really well, even if Tatian's version seems lost to time.

I think that's what gave me the patience to keep typing this thing out. (OCR wouldn't have done, as there's plenty of weird errata.)

Like I said, it just feels so old; getting a glimpse of the mindset of people back then through the language is truly interesting.

I do, however, wish Sei Shonagon had written it.

That is to say, for as ecstatic as its language is, sometimes it feels a bit overly-linearistic. A somewhat whimsical writer like Ms. Sei would have created something above and beyond the canonical four.

I'd memorize it, for sure. I'm sure my oration in any language would improve. It's very clear from the pauses that this version of the gospels was primarily seen as a read-aloud book for church services, otherwise knows as a lectionary.

I'm pretty sure it was meant to be read according to a yearly cycle, probably the same yearly cycle used to read the Carshun.

I didn't mark the verses; I explored the poeticism of the pauses, such as:

والحمد من الله الواحد لا تلتمسون



Which translates:

And praise (is) from G-d, the One -- unsought (by y'all).

Or how about:



اليس من صنع الخارج هو صنع الداخل


Which translates:

Did not the one who made the Outer make the Interior?

Coupled with the hypnotic rhythms of the pauses, it's my favorite way to dip in to the Gospel.

But don't try teaching yourself one of the most difficult non-programming languages in the world just so you can read it and memorize it just yet.

There's no need to drop everything you're doing and just study this magical arrangement of 29 letters on a page.

The printed(ish) copy I worked from is not very good. I'll be making at least two or three different error checks as I typeset this book. At least wait until this repo is archived, someday, and my dual-language text+translation has been typeset and fully corrected.

Once I reach that stage, just for pure cheesy-Ness factor, I'm tempted to divide the work into 5 parts, the way Joyce divided Finnegans Wake attempting to square the Viconian circle.
