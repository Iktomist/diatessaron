Ongoing translating/typesetting of a book once-burned from the swinging 160s.

Was hoping to find some juicy Gnostic bits but, don't get your hopes up, the thing actually 'bytes... The big J uses some swear words, big deal! I guess that's why it was once collected and burned?

But it definitely feels like the oldest writing I've ever spent a long time with.

Curious what AI makes of it: the register is very hard to match in up-to-date English.

The original Syriac comes through really well, even if Tatian's version seems lost to time.

I think that's what gave me the patience to keep typing this thing out. (OCR wouldn't have done, as there's plenty of weird errata.)

Like I said, it just feels so old; getting a glimpse of the mindset of people back then through the language is truly interesting.

I do, however, wish Sei Shonagon had written it.
